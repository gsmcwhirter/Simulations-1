# Plants, Zombies, and Humans

This project is to complete a simulation of a world where plants, zombies, and humans may (or may not, in the end) coexist. The simulation will make substantial use of interfaces and abstract classes to illustrate how they might be employed productively.

## Understanding the Layout

Opening the project in BlueJ, there are a lot of pieces, many of which are different types. Open up each piece and make a list of the following:

1. Which items are classes?
2. Which items are interfaces?
3. Which classes are abstract?
4. For each class, what are all of its superclasses (in order)?
5. For each class, which interfaces does it implement (be sure to list interfaces from superclasses)?

Many of the pieces you will have no need to edit (though you might want to read through them). The pieces we will be focusing on are the Human, Plant, Zombie, DirtTerrain, MyWorld, and SimulationTester classes.
